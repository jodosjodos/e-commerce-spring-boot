# Simple E-Commerce with Spring Boot Microservices

## Overview

This project implements a simple e-commerce application using Spring Boot and a microservices architecture. The key features include:

- **Microservices Architecture:** The application is built as a set of loosely coupled microservices, each responsible for specific functionality.

- **API Gateway:** Communication between microservices is facilitated through an API Gateway, streamlining interactions and providing a unified entry point.

- **Security with Keycloak:** All endpoints are secured using Keycloak, providing robust authentication and authorization services.

- **Asynchronous Communication with Kafka:** Kafka is used for efficient and scalable asynchronous communication between microservices.

- **Service Discovery with Eureka:** Eureka is employed for service discovery, making it easy for microservices to locate and communicate with each other dynamically.

- **Distributed Tracing with Zipkin:** Zipkin provides insights into the flow of requests across different microservices, aiding in monitoring and debugging.

- **Actuator for Monitoring:** Spring Boot Actuator exposes operational information, health checks, and metrics to monitor the health and progress of the application.

- **Dockerized Microservices:** All microservices are containerized using Docker for consistency and easy deployment.
